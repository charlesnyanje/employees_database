## Introduction

The Employees Database is designed to store and manage information about employees within an organization. It's a valuable resource for HR departments, managers, and other stakeholders to maintain accurate and up-to-date employee records.

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

- **Employees**: Contains information about each employee, including their unique ID, name, contact details, position, department, hire date, and more.

- **Departments**: Stores details about different departments within the organization, including their unique ID, name, and location.

- **Positions**: Holds information about various job positions available in the company, including the position ID, title, and job description.

- **Salaries**: Records historical salary information for employees, including their ID, salary amount, effective date, and any additional notes.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Employees Database, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have a compatible database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed.

2. **Database Creation**: Execute the SQL scripts provided in the `sql_scripts` folder. Start with `create_tables.sql` to create the necessary tables. Then, populate the tables with sample data using `sample_data.sql`.

3. **Configuration**: Update the database connection settings in the application or scripts that will interact with the Employees Database.

## Usage

Here's how you can interact with the Employees Database:

- **Retrieve Employee Information**: Use SQL queries to retrieve information about employees, their departments, positions, and salaries.

- **Add New Employee**: Insert a new record into the `Employees` table with relevant information about the employee.

- **Update Employee Data**: Modify existing employee records to reflect changes in contact details, positions, or other relevant information.

- **Generate Reports**: Create custom reports by querying the database for specific criteria, such as employees within a particular department or their salary history.
